Feature: Interface with Github issues with a timer

  I'm a studet at Turing and I need to use an api in my
  personal project. I want to make an app that helps me incorporate
  the suggestions that Josh gave me to help me manage my time. When
  I don't manage my time effectivly I go down rabbit-holes, stay stuck for
  too long, and don't realize how long i am stuck. I'm making this app to help
  me sandbox my workflow by using automatic timers to alert me. I
  need to be able to meet dead-lines that are set by a client.

  Scenerio: timebox my work
    get a repo
       authenticate me.
    Create a user story "Create a CSV parser" that has a default state of 'backlog'
    Has a button, to change the state to 'currently working on', that will start
    a default timer automatically, and give me a message notifiying me when
    the time is up.
    Then I can decide to continue working or to stop.
    If I continue the timer will restart.
    If I stop the card will move back to 'backlog'
